# Intellij IDEA light theme for Visual Studio Code

Intellij light theme modified according my needs and preferences ;-)

## Variables

Easily see what we manipulate:
- global variables are defined as _italic bold_.
- method/function parameters are defined in _italic_.
- local variables have basic variable defined color.
